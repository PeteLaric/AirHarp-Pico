# AirHarp-Pico
A gestural autoharp that functions as a class-compliant USB MIDI controller instrument.

Originally conceived in 2010, the AirHarp is a gestural autoharp that allows the musician to strum chords on an invisible beam of ultrasound.  For several years, I manufactured and sold these musical instruments online.  The entire project is open source.  If you build one, please send me a note!  I'd love to see it.

Cheers,
